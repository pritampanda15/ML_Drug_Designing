## BETA VERSION: PSICHIC<sub>XL</sub> Selectivity Profiling

We have currently released a beta version of our notebook platform to demonstrate how PSICHIC<sub>XL</sub> (still known as Pre-trained PSICHIC in our preprint and in the 'trained_weights' folder of this repo) can be applied to the crucial task of selectivity profiling. This process is vital post-hit identification to ensure the efficacy of small-molecule ligands and to reduce off-target effects, a key consideration in drug discovery due to the polypharmacology inherent in many compounds. Our case study on AR subtypes illustrates PSICHIC<sub>XL</sub>'s capability to predict ligand promiscuity or selectivity across the highly conserved orthosteric binding sites of the four adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes: A<sub>1</sub>R, A<sub>2A</sub>R, A<sub>2B</sub>R, and A<sub>3</sub>R. It further demonstrates how interaction fingerprints can interpret the mechanism of interactions, identifying selectivity determinants directly from sequence dataâ€”a particularly challenging task for A<sub>1</sub>R due to the similarity across AR subtypes.


The complete version of the platform will be released once the paper is updated, and the selectivity profiling section is made publicly available. In the meantime, we invite you to explore the beta version, adaptable for any protein dataset: [Colab Online Platform](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huankoh/PSICHIC/blob/main/selectivity/PSICHIC_Selectivity.ipynb)

Stay tuned for the full release of our platform, set to provide insights into achieving subtype selectivity, a crucial step towards the development of safer and more effective therapeutics.
